## Description

This application is the first I've created that not only serves an online purpose, but also has offline capabilities. 

The budget tracker allows the user to add or subtract funds whether online or offline. 

Because of it's offline capabilities, the application is much more user friendly. 

One challenging aspect of this application was getting caching to work. Though the errors can sometimes be difficult to unpack, they are not impossible!

The deployed version of the application can be found at:
